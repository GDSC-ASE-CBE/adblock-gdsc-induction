                    Good! Having an adblocker installed / bundled with your
                    browser is a really good measure to stay relatively safe
                    (and less annoyed) on the internet
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Oopss!! Adblock not detected :\</h2>
                <p>
                    Having an adblocker installed / bundled with your browser is
                    a really good measure to stay relatively safe (and less
                    annoyed) on the internet. Do get one soon! Good options
                    include uBlock origin or adBlock Plus, or using a browser
                    which has adblock pre-configured, like Brave.
